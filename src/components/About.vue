			In this project, we create a Machine Learning example project,<br/>
			showcasing how we can model & predict future statistics<br/>
			given our historical Data.<br/>

			<br/>
			In our historical charts, the date starts at 1975.<br/>
			This is when the Gross Domestic Product <br/>
			of most first-world countries<br/>
			started to dramatically increase, <br/>
			a couple of years since then-US President Richard Nixon <br/>
			has taken the US Dollar off the Gold Standard.<br/>
